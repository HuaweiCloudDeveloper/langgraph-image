## Project Introduction

[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents – including Klarna, Replit, Elastic, and more – LangGraph is a low-level orchestration framework for building, managing, and deploying long-running, stateful agents.

### **Core Features:**

- **State based workflow:**LangGraph supports state based workflows, where the state is automatically saved at each step, and the agent can pause, resume, or recover from errors. This enables intelligent agents to remember what is happening and maintain context
- **Support for loops and conditional logic**:LangGraph allows defining processes that include loops, which is crucial for most proxy architectures. It also supports conditional logic to achieve dynamic decision-making
- **Human intervention**:LangGraph supports human intervention in approval or editing operations, ensuring that critical tasks are monitored by someone

The open - source image product [**LangGraph -agent orchestration framework **]() provided by this project has LangGraph and its related runtime environment pre - installed and provides deployment templates. Come and refer to the usage guide to easily start an "out - of - the - box" and efficient experience!

> **System requirements are as follows:**

> - CPU: 2GHz or higher
> - RAM: 4GB or larger
